We're living in a world of indulgence and seem not to cherish the small (or larger) daily treats anymore. As a cousin of mine once noted: we are able to go out for coffee and food daily without thinking to much of it's costs. We're the lucky few but somehow forgot about that. We're privileged but we've got accustomed to it.

Living in Austria our grand-parents and parents started with almost nothing after the second world war. Then came a long line of firsts: cars, television sets, an united Europe, mobile phones, the possibility of traveling abroads, higher-education. Things that my generation takes for granted.

I'll try to remember myself to appreciate daily life more. But it's easy to forget.
