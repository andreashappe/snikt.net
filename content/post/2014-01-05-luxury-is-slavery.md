It's weakness. Well at least un-enjoyed luxury that has become an everyday event is. This has nothing to do with morals.

Luxury costs money. Making money makes you dependant and consumes your free time, it reduces your financial freedom.

So if you're spending your life on luxury make sure that it counts and you're enjoying it every moment.
