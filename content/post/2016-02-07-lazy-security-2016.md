Keeping a good security and privacy is tough work. There's always a trade-off
between effort and achieved security. In this blog post I'll mention small
things that a ``normal'' person should be able to perform --- that still
increase the overall security of that user's data. <!-- more -->

## Choose your Liege

Bruce Schneier talks about the comeback of [feudal
security](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/feudal_sec.html): you
choose your [liege lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_%28feudal%29) and
depend upon him for providing security. You pledge yourself to Google, Facebook
or Apple. Your liege protects his servers (with your data) and might defend
your data/emails in a legal court --- for which I as a private person would not
have the monies --- but for that it gets access to all your data. Choose your
liege carefully and only have few of them. For me Google is essential. It's
hosted mail service gets all my possible password reminder/reset emails. If it
gets compromised, it's game over for me. Similar for me is
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com). Identify those main trust anchors and use
secure and unique passwords for them. If possible enable
two-factor-authentication (2FA). This forces an attacker to not just steal your
password in cyberspace, but she would also need to steal a second factor (i.e.
phone or RSA token) in the physical world. Few "private" hackers will escalate
to this level.

## Physical Host Security

The next step is physical device security, i.e. what happens if an attacker has
short-term access to your computer. The most basic setup is to enable
hard-drive encryption. This raises the effort to get your data. But then, if an
attacker has access to your hardware he could add a backdoor to the unencrypted
boot partition, (UEFI) BIOS or firmware (see [evil maid
attacks](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/10/evil_maid_attac.html).
To prevent that
[SecureBoot](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/UEFI_Secure_Boot_Guide/chap-UEFI_Secure_Boot_Guide-What_is_Secure_Boot.html)
would be needed, but it is only [partially
supported](https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/39339.html) by Linux and Windows. Macs
have no protection whatsoever. Oh, by the way, you still have to [trust all
your hardware
vendors](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/x86_harmful.pdf).

When it comes to operating system security, the most important thing is to update often.

## Secure your Web-Browser

The next logical step is to secure your browser. I'd strongly suggest to user Firefox/Chromium and then install some basic plugins:

* uBlock Origin to remove Ads. This sounds bad, but there's no technical distinction between advertisement and third-party JavaScript-based malware.
* Privacy Badger: this reduces some of the tracking widgets/bugs/codes that are delivered by most websites
* HTTPS everywhere: if you're using HTTPS an attacker cannot eavesdrop on your communication by just connecting to the same WLAN/network. This plugin automatically switches communication to HTTPS if possible.
* LastPass: this is a web-based password manager. This allows for unique automatically generated passwords for each used website. If your LastPass-stored passwords get lost, you'll have to reset those through your mail account so don't store your mail account password in LastPass. Giving all your passwords
to a third-party is controversial but LastPass has a good security history and I trust LastPass more
to keep my passwords secure than I'd trust every website where I've created an account.

## Secure your Communication

The next step is to improve communication (transport-level) security. I am using a VPN for that (in
my case [Private Access Security](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/SNIKT001) which
claim that they do not store any logging information; I get some referral fee if you're using the
link to create a new account). The basic idea is that all traffic transported over the VPN is private
between your computer and the VPN provider. This mostly thaws attacks by your provider and your country's content provider mafia. You have to trust the VPN provider though; but then, your data should
already have been encrypted (i.e. through HTTPS everywhere).

## GPG

Please use [GnuPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard) for your
emails. With it only the mail's receiver is able to read the information within
the email. If you remember the initial liege lord discussion: with GPG even
your liege cannot read your sent/received emails (but still can gather with
whom you were communicating with). GPG has a bit of a learning curve, I'd
suggest to go to a nearby [crypto
party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoParty), i.e. those are the events
for [Austria](https://cryptoparty.at/).

GPG uses two matching keys: a secret-key that only the owner should know and a
public key that can be.. well.. be made public. If you remember the ``evil
maid'' attack --- i.e. an attacker ` with short-term access to your computer
--- storing the secret key unsecured on your computer compromises the overall
security. The solution for this are secure tokens, i.e.
[YubiKeys](https://www.yubico.com/). With this token you can transfer your
secret-key upon the token (which connects via USB) and then take only the token
with you. An attacker with short-term access to your computer now cannot get
your private key; an attacker with access to the token can use the secret-key
but cannot duplicate it and is thus limited.

## Mobile Security

For mobile security it's complicated. I applaud Google and Apple for trying to go dark. Encryption
on this level always has the problem of reduced battery run-time and performance. My mobile check-list is:

* use an regularly updated open-source operating system. That's [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) for me, you can check [here for device support](https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Devices). Update often.
* Use [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/#page-top) for messaging. If interested into technical details read [their news blog](https://whispersystems.org/blog/).
* If performance allows it (mostly down to having a 64-bit ARM CPU, i.e. ARM A53 or A57) enable full-disk encryption. If that is too slow, look into the remote device wiping facilities of your chosen platform. You'll have to accept that your data will be compromised if your device is stolen by an attacker
but at least you can improve the "device lost" use-case.
* On Android, install Firefox with all the prior mentioned security and privacy plugins

## So what?

Most of the listed possibilities are free to use; the only ones that you'll
need money for are the VPN account and hardware tokens (i.e. YubiKey). Those
are not mandatory. Sometimes you can get a free VPN account from your
university. How much is your privacy worth to you? If you don't take any step
at all the answer is "nothing". You'll get what you deserve.
