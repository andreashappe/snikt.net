2019 was a year in which I expanded my comfort zone and forced myself to face some fears. I haven't always been victorious, there's enough to face next year. I see progress and hope; I do not feel trapped in my situation but rather see a comfy base from which I can explore further.

One thing that worked out great was teaching at FH/Technikum Wien. While I was more than a bit nervous in the beginning, teaching grew upon me over time. Having great students helped, also that I breathe the stuff that I teach. The ability to give back some of my experience to 60-ish students each year feels meaningful. Getting some "thank you"-messages after my lecture was unexpected. Will definitely do this again next year, this term I will focus upon my presentation.

Pentesting at CoreTec is still fun. Sadly I didn't have enough time to finish my [Offensive Security AWAE certification](https://www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe/) due to too many interesting work projects.. so this is on my list for 2020. Oh, and I am certified to do testing for the [EU-Richtlinie zur Netz- und Informationssicherheit (NIS-RL)](https://www.digitales.oesterreich.gv.at/eu-richtlinie-zur-netz-und-informationssicherheit), sounds like fun times ahead.

Travelling: compared to my work trips during my AIT/research-center time I am travelling a lot less. But the destinations and spare-time there matter too. this year brought me to Berlin (We Are Developers conference), Poland (visiting the concentration camps at Birkenau-Ausschwitz), Amsterdam (OWASP Global AppSec conference) and Spain (bouldering trip). That's a nice selection, widening one's horizons. I'd like to to some non-first-world travelling next year too.

Health-wise, I#ve started to bike to work in Summer --- and am surprisingly enjoying the freedom that biking the city brings. Small stuff, but this improves my quality of life more than I thought. Sports-wise I want to branch out from bouldering a bit next year.

I did a LASIK eye correction for my myoptia at the end of November. My eye sight is way better than before, can walk around without glasses but I do have some problems reading text for now. Will to my follow-up check at the end of February, if the situation hasn't improved, I would ask about a second corrective operation.

Still not smoking too. On the other hand, I am not happy with my alcoohol intake and will work on that next year. It's not as if I'm regularly drunk, but this year's christmas parties were tough and I am not that young anymore. Too much recoverytime for doing stuff while drunk.

Money-wise, life is good. Income from teaching and pen-testing gives me a positive cash-flow. I do have some stock investments that should help me when (if) I grow old enough to miss the state-provided pension. The situation was that good, that I closed down my small-time company to maximize my free time and focus more upon research/teaching.
