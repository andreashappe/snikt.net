Recently I've found an old post-it with guidelines I wrote myself a couple of years back, two of those stood out:

* make mistakes
* don't buy stupid stuff

Seems like I haven't been the most consistent person back then. The post-it got discovered during a clean-up session of my flat, the same session brought up the following stupidly-bought-and-never-used gadgets:

* one [BBC micro:bit](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_micro:bit) that should be able to [capture Bluetooth Low Energy transmissions](https://github.com/virtualabs/btlejack)
* one [Proxmark 3 RV4](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1408815241/proxmark3-rdv-40#) that should be able to do some nifty RFID stuff (and that I was recently [able to fix](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/issues/35))
* one [Realtek Software-Defined Radio USB Stick](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/) (rtl-sdr)..

My new year's resolution (or rather near-future resolution) is to do /something/ hackery with that stuff. Suggestions more than welcome.
